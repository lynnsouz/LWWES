# Challange
**Study [LWW-Element-Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#LWW-Element-Set_(Last-Write-Wins-Element-Set)) and implement a state-based LWW-Element-Dictionary with test cases.** 

Similar to LWW-Element-Set, the dictionary variant you are going to implement will store a timestamp for each key-value pair. In addition to the add and remove operations, the dictionary variant will also allow updating the value of a key. There should be a function to _merge_ two dictionaries. Test cases should be clearly written and document what aspect of CRDT they test. We recommend you to spend **no more than 4 hours** on this challenge. The provided readings should be sufficient to understand LWW-Element-Set and CRDT on a high level. You are welcome to dig deeper on those but we expect you to come up with the implementation yourself without any help from other open sourced implementations.
